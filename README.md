# Hangman Assignment

Use this file as a README documentation (edit me!)

About the game:

Hangman game. Computer chooses a word, and you have to guess it by either guessing one letter at a time or directly guessing the word. No capital letters. Maximum of 10 incorrect guesses. You can play as many times as you want to. 

How to play:

Guess a letter. If your guessed letter is in the word, it will reveal all the locations of where that letter is in the word. If your guess is not in the word, it is an incorrect guess.

You can also directly guess the word. If it is the correct guess, the game ends. If it is the wrong guess, it is an incorrect guess. 

 Incorrect guesses are also added if you enter characters that are not letters (e.g. spaces, numbers, symbols, blanks, etc.), if you guess more than one letter at once, or if you guess a capital letter (all words, including proper nouns, are in lowercase). 
 
 The game ends when you reach 10 incorrect guesses or when you successfully guess all the letters in the word or successfully guess the word. You can play again as many times as you want to.
